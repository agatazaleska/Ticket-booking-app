# Ticket-booking-app
This is backend for ticket booking app - a recruitment task for Touk.
I do not own the idea for this project.

The ticket booking app enables the client to:

- get the screenings at the given date and time interval,
- get information about a specific screening,
- get information about screening's room and available seats,
- request a reservation after providing his data,
- get information about the reservation: total cost and expiration time.

The application handles multiple rooms.



### Additional assumptions

Additionally, the system checks the following conditions:

- a reservation cannot be made later then 15 minutes before the screening start,
- client's data (name and surname) has to be in correct format,
- there cannot be an empty reservation,
- there cannot be a single place left over in a row between two already reserved
  places.

The application handles polish characters properly.
